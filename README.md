## üîç Data Preprocessing Guide

### Essential Preprocessing Steps

1. **Dataset Loading**
   - Load your dataset using appropriate methods
   - Verify the dataset structure and contents

2. **Missing Value Handling**
   - Identify and document missing values
   - Apply either removal or imputation strategies
   - Maintain records of all modifications

3. **Exploratory Visualization**
   - Generate distribution plots for numerical features
   - Create correlation visualizations
   - Examine feature relationships

4. **Outlier Management**
   - Detect outliers using statistical methods
   - Apply clinically appropriate treatments
   - Document outlier handling procedures

5. **Forming train and test datasets**
   - make X and Y variables
   - splitting data into train and test sets
   - standarize train data set

6. **Data Transformation**
   - Identify and address feature skewness
   - Apply necessary normalization techniques
   - Verify transformations visually

7. **Feature Correlation**
   - Analyze multicollinearity between features
   - Plan dimensionality reduction if needed
   - Document correlation findings

8. **Class Balance**
   - Evaluate target class distribution
   - Address severe imbalances if present
   - Choose appropriate balancing methods

9. **Transforming Train and Test Data Sets into GPU**
   - Convert train and test data sets into GPU-supported data structures
   - Use libraries such as cuDF and cuML for GPU acceleration
   - Ensure compatibility between data format and GPU models

## üéØ Training and Evaluating

1. **Model Training**
   - Train the following classifiers:
     - KNeighborsClassifier
     - LogisticRegression
     - RandomForestClassifier
     - SVC
     - XGBClassifier
   - Ensure all models are trained on the prepared and standardized dataset.

2. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate each model using the following metrics:
     - F1 Score
     - Accuracy Score
     - ROC AUC Score
     - Log Loss
   - Document and compare performance across all metrics.

3. **Model Selection and Saving**
   - Select the model with the best performance according to project requirements.
   - Save the chosen model using appropriate serialization methods (pickle).
   - Prepare the saved model for integration into the prediction system.
